			I'm currently employed as an apprentice java developer at <a href="https://sbb.ch" title="SBB Website" class="ext">SBB</a>, although I am actively looking for a job as that apprenticeship will end this summer. At work I usually use Java 8 with Spring and Eclipse RCP.
			<br>
			In my free time I enjoy <a title="solving twisty puzzles" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/" class="ext">cubing</a>, reading and watching SciFi stories, programming, playing games and following space exploration.
			<br>
			I also love tinkering with <a class="ext" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/" title="Ricing">Linux computers</a>. My <a target="_blank" href="/resources/img/setup-neofetch.png"> current setup</a>.

			You can find the code to the page <a class="ext" href="https://github.com/martyschaer/website">on my github</a>. Please do suggest improvements if you have any to make.
