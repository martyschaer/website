This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Very, very easy to set up and all pages are written in Markdown ([Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) dialect).

I used some custom CSS to make it look right.

You can see the source of the site [on github](https://github.com/martyschaer/website).
